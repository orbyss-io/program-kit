## Governance Completion Evidence *(mandatory)*

For each vertical outcome, include the task sequence that delivers and verifies the complete path before broad horizontal expansion. Include tasks for applicable contract, architecture-boundary, integration, and acceptance evidence.

- **Roadmap transition**: move the matching entry to Active only when implementation starts; record Delivered only after its verification evidence exists.
- **Architecture evidence**: update the dependency test, contract test, or ADR evidence required by the plan.
- **Non-goal protection**: do not add tasks for unapproved technology adoption, cross-feature implementation references, or unrelated platform work.
- **Path and ownership protection**: every task path must be declared by the plan's
  `artifact-ownership.json`, recognized by an accepted profile, or paired with the plan's exact
  `STRUCTURE-DELTA: <path>`. Never ask implementation to edit `eng/program-kit/**`; name the
  consumer-owned extension point (`Directory.Build.props/targets`, feature adapter, `vite.config`,
  or consumer deployment configuration) instead.

- **External host protection**: when `ProgramKit.Host` is selected, create only packable feature
  packages and consumer activation/release inputs. Never create a repository-owned `.Host` project
  or application `Program.cs`; include `ProgramKitFeatureIdentity`, `shells.json`,
  `hostsettings.json`, package-closure staging, and digest-bound external-host evidence tasks.
- **Dependency graph protection**: resolve exact npm peer, engine, and platform constraints in an
  isolated lockfile-only check before implementation; never use force/legacy peer bypasses.
- **Authorization ownership protection**: test managed endpoint permission metadata and real
  resource/state/effect rules separately; never task a consumer feature with parsing provider roles
  or canonical permission claims, and do not invent an inner service for a no-effect access probe.
