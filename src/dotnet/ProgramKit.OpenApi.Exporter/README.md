# ProgramKit.OpenApi.Exporter

Program Kit-managed build tool that composes OpenAPI from a consumer application's validated,
staged feature-package closure without opening a network listener or running shell lifecycle
initializers. Consumer repositories invoke it through `eng/program-kit/openapi_pipeline.py`; do not
add this package to feature or application projects.
