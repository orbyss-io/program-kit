# .NET runtime and runnable-host release profile

Apply this reference when .NET is selected unless intake explicitly opts out of the Program Kit runtime.

## Host boundary

- `ProgramKit.Host` is feature-free plumbing: Nuplane package loading, the Nuplane-to-CShells assembly
  provider, CShells configuration/routing, and CShells-only eager activation.
- It has no application-bundle parser, package/feature policy, database client, authentication, OpenAPI,
  business endpoint, or feature-health aggregation.
- Actual behavior arrives as runtime packages. HTTP, identity, persistence, tasks, and health implementations
  belong to explicit features and their owned contracts.
- Until a feature-health contribution interface exists, do not invent a host dependency-readiness model.

## Feature creation and activation closure

The authoritative activation shape is `CShells:Shells:<shell-name>:Features:<feature-identity>` in the real
consumer-owned `shells.json`. Add a reviewed selection deterministically with:

```text
python eng/program-kit/feature_metadata.py activate --shells shells.json --shell <name> --feature <identity>
```

A feature project is packable, belongs to the solution, sets `ProgramKitFeatureIdentity`, and sets
`AssemblyName` equal to `PackageId`. It references host-supplied CShells/framework abstractions with
`PrivateAssets=all`; it does not reference the host, Nuplane runtime, or peer feature implementations.
Optional dependency, route, and dormant metadata is embedded during pack.

Tasks cover the project, solution inclusion, explicit identity, `shells.json` activation, runnable-image
inclusion, and missing/duplicate/dependency/route/dormancy tests. `eng/program-kit/runnable_host.py stage`
enforces those constraints while assembling image inputs. The host does not know or repeat this policy.

## Runnable-host release

One application release produces one runnable image. Its Dockerfile derives from the approved digest-pinned
`ProgramKit.Host`, copies the validated package closure to `/app/packages`, and adds the consumer-owned
`hostsettings.json` plus `shells.json`. Secrets stay in deployment configuration.

After the registry supplies the immutable image digest, the release workflow emits `runnable-host.json`.
The descriptor contains the application ID/version/source commit, image repository/tag/digest/reference,
and the exact secret-free settings plus their hashes. This descriptor is deployment/release evidence; it is
not a manifest interpreted by `ProgramKit.Host`.

Production package feeds, watching, reconciliation, and reload policy are application deployment choices.
Container health is also selected by the application once its feature-health contract is known.

## Boundaries retained from the wider .NET profile

- Central package management, locked restore, deterministic pack, and package-source mapping are mandatory.
- `shells.json` and `hostsettings.json` remain scaffold-once consumer-owned inputs.
- Managed OpenAPI production runs after package-closure staging through
  `eng/program-kit/openapi_pipeline.py`. Consumers register complete producer, compatibility,
  isolated client-generation, and application-compile contracts in
  `.program-kit/openapi-contracts.json`; the external host remains feature-free.
- Domain and persistence guidance remains feature-owned. No shared `DbContext`, generic repository, provider,
  or readiness probe belongs in the host.
