# develop-software

## Identity and trigger

`develop-software` owns development-flow routing for a human-started software
request. Use it when a human asks to develop software but has not selected the
design, approved-plan implementation, or bounded maintenance flow, or asks
which backed development flow should handle the work.

## Purpose

Classify the explicit request together with accepted repository artifacts and a
fresh capability-availability snapshot. Produce exactly one routing outcome:
`routed`, `human-decision-required`, or `flow-unavailable`. A routed outcome
names at most one next capability and never grants authority.

## Non-goals

- Do not design or implement the requested software.
- Do not approve a design, plan, release, deployment, or destructive action.
- Do not treat routing as authority to start another flow.
- Do not route release qualification, promotion, or publication into a
  development capability.
- Do not create hooks, watchers, autonomous loops, MCP bindings, tool bindings,
  runtime services, or provider integrations.

## Inputs and outputs

Inputs:

- The human's explicit request or intent.
- The current repository-owned source truth and accepted artifact state.
- The canonical `.agent-capabilities/capabilities/INDEX.md`.
- Any named design, plan, approval, or supersession evidence needed to classify
  the request.
- Accepted architecture and current source truth needed to distinguish a
  bounded compatible change from material new intent.

Outputs:

- One explicit routing outcome with a reason.
- At most one next capability reference when the outcome is `routed`.
- A digest-bound development receipt when the backing Program Kit operation is
  available and the human requests a durable receipt.
- A concise refusal or decision request when routing cannot proceed safely.

## Preconditions

- A human has started or requested the work.
- The repository and intended scope are explicit.
- The capability index and relevant artifacts can be read from repository-owned
  source truth.
- Any named next capability is `available` in the canonical index.

## Allowed actions

- Read repository guidance, the capability index, and explicitly relevant
  design, plan, approval, and receipt artifacts.
- Validate supplied artifacts with deterministic Program Kit operations.
- Calculate exact file digests needed by a routing result or receipt.
- Recommend one available next capability or stop with one of the two
  zero-capability outcomes.

## Prohibited actions

- Do not infer approval, authority, identity, time, or evidence.
- Do not route to an unavailable, missing, or unregistered capability.
- Do not edit source, design, plan, capability, index, or runtime files.
- Do not inspect sibling repositories or unrelated history.
- Do not access secrets or the network unless the human separately authorizes
  an in-scope read.
- Do not run destructive commands.

## Stop conditions

Stop with `human-decision-required` when intent, scope, repository, accepted
artifact state, semantic mapping, or the choice among maintenance, design, and
approved-plan implementation is ambiguous. Stop with `flow-unavailable` when
the requested flow is absent or unavailable, including release, qualification,
or promotion flows. Stop without routing when a named approval is missing,
changed, rejected, conditional, or superseded.

## Source of truth and freshness

The current human request wins over remembered context. Repository-owned
artifacts are authoritative only at their exact current bytes. Capability
availability comes only from
`.agent-capabilities/capabilities/INDEX.md`; refresh its digest immediately
before emitting a durable result. Provider adapters are registration
mechanics, not procedure or availability sources.

## Procedure

1. Confirm the human-started request, repository, and requested outcome.
2. Read applicable `AGENTS.md` guidance and the canonical capability index.
3. Identify explicit accepted design, plan, and approval artifacts without
   searching unrelated history.
4. Validate any artifact needed to distinguish a bounded compatible change,
   new/material intent, and an exactly approved implementation plan.
5. Classify:
   - one small architecture-compatible change -> `maintain-software`;
   - new or materially changed architecture, mechanism, schema kind, security
     boundary, package family, compatibility, deployment, or runtime topology
     -> `design-software`;
   - exact valid approved plan -> `implement-software-plan`;
   - unclear semantics, mapping, scope, or missing decision ->
     `human-decision-required`;
   - unavailable flow -> `flow-unavailable`.
6. Confirm the selected capability is available and record at most one next
   capability.
7. If a durable result is requested, bind the request/artifact and index bytes,
   supplied principal/time/evidence, and selected outcome through the backed
   Program Kit receipt contracts.
8. Report the outcome and stop. Continue into the selected flow only after the
   human explicitly requests or confirms that continuation.

Judgment occurs in steps 3-6. Deterministic validation and hashing support the
decision but do not make it or grant authority.

## Verification and failure reporting

Verify that the outcome is one of the three allowed values, zero-capability
outcomes contain no next capability, a routed outcome contains exactly one
available capability, and any receipt binds exact current digests. Report
missing artifacts, unavailable flows, validation failures, and freshness
failures explicitly; never fall back to a guessed route.

## Authority and safety boundaries

The human retains all authority. Routing conveys no approval and no permission
to modify files, use secrets, access the network, or take destructive actions.
Filesystem reads stay inside the named repository. Any later mutation follows
the selected capability's narrower authority and safety rules.

## Compatibility and versioning

Preserve this stable capability ID while routing semantics remain compatible.
Changes to outcomes, authority boundaries, required inputs, or receipt meaning
require an explicit compatibility review and updated capability digest.
Renames, splits, supersession, or retirement require human authority, an index
update, wrapper migration, and no stale registration.

## Provider wrapper mapping and drift check

The inert Codex adapter template at
`.agent-capabilities/provider-adapters/codex/develop-software/SKILL.md` and
the inert Claude Code adapter template at
`.agent-capabilities/provider-adapters/claude/develop-software/SKILL.md` may
contain only provider registration metadata and one canonical-path token.
Initialization renders Codex beneath `.agents/skills/` and Claude Code beneath
`.claude/skills/`. Verify that the thin workspace wrapper points to this exact
canonical file, copies no procedure, binds source and output digests in the
complete multi-provider ownership lock, and preserves every other exact
provider binding.
